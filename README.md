## Algorithm for verification and generating MD5 checksum in header sequences of FASTA files.
Used for analysing header sequences of FASTA file inputed by user.
Has two modes: verification and generating.

During verification checks whether there are MD5 checksums in the sequence headers. If they are, compares them with the checksums generated by algorithm earlier: if they differ - the wrong header is shown in output.

The second used for the cases, when there is no MD5 checksums in the sequence header. As a result the user get the new file with added calculated MD5 chechsums.
